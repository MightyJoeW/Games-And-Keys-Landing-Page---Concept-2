### Origin
Games and Keys was created out of the love for video game music as well as the desire to help others learn. In 2013, I entered and won Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Firefly Pendant video contest with a cosplay piano rendition of the main theme from The Last of Us ([watch here](https://youtu.be/0eacOSCYwnc)). 

Because of the positive feedback, I created a Synthesia piano tutorial for the theme and uploaded to YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/sb2ZC5WjjrA). The tutorial led to many turorial requests for other game themes which evolved into a growing collection of tutorials, sheet music, and midi files. 

## Where to find it?
The old [GamesAndKeys.com](http://www.gamesandkeys.com/) is still live on Blogger. The site was initially created simply to provide users with a place to download sheet music and midi files, so I will be transitioning to my Bootstrap and jQuery-powered responsive website once these new pages are finished.
